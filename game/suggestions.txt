  1. I had no idea what to do when I opened the game. There weren't any texts telling you what to do
  and the UI wasn't intuitive enough to let me know what I should do without thinking about it.

  2. I tried pressing random buttons and nothing seemed to work.

  3. I don't get the need to put the two buttons in the lower left corner. I think you shouldn't put unimplemented features
  in your interface since the users will tend to click on them and will just be disappointed when they find out that the
  button doesn't even work. Instead of creating excitement and hype about a new feature, it just tends to disappoint the
  user. It can be a pain point

  4. Have a starting screen for the game so the user wouldn't be lost when they enter the game and it's already starting.

  5. It may be just me but I don't know how I can make the game to work from the web version.

  6. I know you're trying to go for a 3D projection of the game but it leaves a lot of dead black space around. Maybe it
  would be better to just have a flat design for it.

  7. Lastly, there are overflows in the design



AvalancheOfFox:

  Unclear to what stage turn is at and notifications for bottom alert/prompt should be more noticeable.
  As well, unclear whose turn it is; some sort of tutorial necessary. @TheMartinCrabtree and I tested. Super cool so far though!


TheMartinCrabtree:

  It might be helpful to add an animation/border-highlight to cards that can currently be played,
  and auto-pass phases where no card can be played.
