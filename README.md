# Architecture

The application is divided in modules:
- [game](game/README.md): responsible for playing matches.
- [admin](admin/README.md): responsible for user and decks management (not implemented yet).



# Backlog

The backlog is managed in Kanban style at:
 - https://github.com/antonioalonzi/mtg/projects/1
 
Stories labelled `with guidelines` are very well described and easy to be picked up for people who want to start
contributing and learning the project.
